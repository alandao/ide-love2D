# ide-love2d
## WIP
This Visual Studio Code extension adds commands for running Love2D on the current folder.
Only tested on Windows, sorry Mac and Linux users.

**Usage:**
Set "love2d.path" in your user settings to where you've installed Love2D.

Ex:
{
    "love2d.path": "C:/Program Files/LOVE/love.exe"
}

**Features:**
* Run Love2D on the current open folder

**TODO:**
* Add debugging support
* Configuration options for Love2D

**Enjoy!**
